# NFT (Non Funglible Tokens) Timeline 

This website is focused on NFTs evolution and first uses of NFTs in relation to Art and Music. So I'm not going to  mentioning crypto art pioneers like @cryptograffiti, @coin_artist and others unless linked to novel or first time NFT use. The information is evolving and there maybe mistakes as I'm still working on it.

Still working on finding:

- (first gif NFT by platform?)
- (first video NFT minted by platform ?)
- (first 3d file format support by platform ?)
- (first Poetry as NFT by platform?)

Please add corrections and additions - https://forms.gle/VwNCnaWGf4jmQpcHA
