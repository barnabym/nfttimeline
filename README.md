# Artist's Guide to NFTs

Basic and incomplete information for artists trying to find out about NFTs.

# What is an NFT?

NFT stands for non-fungible token. Basically a digital good. In terms of Art, it means an artwork like an image such as a still image file, gif, 3d file, or video can be 'minted' (created with an identifier) on a 'blockchain' (kind of like a database or a ledger). Sometimes the file can be stored or referenced on a blockchain such as IPFS or Arweave.

Here are some links to some video explainers:

# What is a wallet?

You'll need one of these to send ether (currency used by main NFT platforms at the moment), pay for minting and to recieve payment.

Coinbase is a good way to convert normal currency into ether that can then be sent to the wallet.

# How to get a wallet?

One of the commonly used wallets is Metamask. Install the Metamask browser extension.
